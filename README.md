# OpenArvello

OpenArvello is a project aiming to keep Arvello fully open source after the controversial relicensing to Creative Commons.

## Updates

OpenArvello will mostly only recieve updates when Arvello gets updated. I will reimplement the feature MYSELF WITHOUT USING ANY CODE FROM THE ORIGINAL ARVELLO and ship it.
We might ship updates before Arvello if they are security related
