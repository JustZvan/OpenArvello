# OpenArvello

OpenArvello is a project aiming to keep Arvello fully open source after the controversial relicensing to Creative Commons.

OpenArvello has been revived because we need to fight for Arvello! This isn't just about Arvello, think about it. If Arvello can do it, what other products can do it?

## Updates

OpenArvello will mostly only recieve updates when Arvello gets updated. I will reimplement the feature MYSELF WITHOUT USING ANY CODE FROM THE ORIGINAL ARVELLO and ship it.
We might ship updates before Arvello if they are security related
