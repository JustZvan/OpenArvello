# DISCONTINUED

This project was discontinued due to legal threats by fmis13. He was claiming it was never MIT. I do not want to pour in hours of my life into court battles. Please find any alternatives to Arvello. I am currently developing a modern alternative to this app that looks like it was made a few years ago when Bootstrap was the hot new thing.

# OpenArvello

OpenArvello is a project aiming to keep Arvello fully open source after the controversial relicensing to Creative Commons.

## Updates

OpenArvello will mostly only recieve updates when Arvello gets updated. I will reimplement the feature MYSELF WITHOUT USING ANY CODE FROM THE ORIGINAL ARVELLO and ship it.
We might ship updates before Arvello if they are security related
